# SpeedTester
GUI based utility that takes hourly readings using Ookla speedtest CLI. The background worker will take hourly readings and update a CSV file.
The CSV file will be read by the gui when its started and you can view a graphical representation of you WiFi speeds over the course of the day.
Developed out of a love for Ooklas speedtest utiltys and a hatred of Plusnets average download speeds.

The CSV Forger is basically now useless but was designed to make CSV files the WinForms part could read and display so I didn't have to wait for valid input.
